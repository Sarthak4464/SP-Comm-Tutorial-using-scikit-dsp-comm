A tutorial on signal processing and communications using `scikit-dsp-comm`, hardware interfacing to a software defined radio (SDR). 

## Introduction
This project provides the set-up instructions and content needed for the Scipy 2017 tutorial on signal processing and communications using the `scikit-dsp-comm` package. To get the most out of this tutorial you will want to take the time to install and configure both software and hardware interface drivers for the RTL-SDR low-cost software defined radio platform.

The following sections of this **README** will first detail the step you need to take to prepare your system for live radio frequency (RF) signal capture from and RTL-SDR hardware USB dongle. Each operating system, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, have slightly different configuration needs. Following the driver set-up there ...
